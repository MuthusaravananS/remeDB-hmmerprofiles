1. This repository contains hmm profiles of enzymes with bioremediation potential collected from remeDB on 21 June 2025.
2. remeDb is available at: https://www.niot.res.in/Remedb/
3.  RemeDB aims at identifying Pollutant Degrading Enzymes (PDE) from metagenomic sequences.

Enables classification and prediction novel enzymes classes.

User interprtable outputs generated at lightning fast speed ( number of computer threads )

Enzymes associated with bioremediation were categorized under 3 categories:

> Hydrocarbon degrading enzymes

> Plastic degrading enzymes

> Dye degrading enzymes
