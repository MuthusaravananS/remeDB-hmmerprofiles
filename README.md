This repository, updated on June 21, 2025, houses HMM profiles of enzymes with bioremediation capabilities, sourced from RemeDB (https://www.niot.res.in/Remedb/).

RemeDB is a tool designed to identify Pollutant Degrading Enzymes (PDEs) within metagenomic sequences. It facilitates the classification and prediction of novel enzyme classes, delivering user-interpretable outputs rapidly through the utilization of multiple computer threads.

The enzymes relevant to bioremediation within this repository are categorized into three main groups:

    Hydrocarbon degrading enzymes
    Plastic degrading enzymes
    Dye degrading enzymes

For further information and to cite RemeDB, please refer to:

A notebook file is also included in this repository to guide users in performing HMMER searches against RemeDB for their target proteins.
